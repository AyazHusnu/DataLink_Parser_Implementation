# Tactical Data Parsing and Visualization Project

This project focuses on parsing, interpreting, and visualizing a sample Tactical Data signal of the J.3.2 Air Track message type from Datalink 16's J-series messages received by the Link 16 terminal.

## Features

- Parsing and interpreting J.3.2 Air Track messages from Datalink 16's J-series messages.
- Development of a simulator that generates a sample 64-bit J.3.2 Air Track message and sends it to a specific TCP port.
- Implementation of a backend component that listens to the simulated data, parses, and interprets it.
- User interface development using JavaFX on the frontend.
- Utilization of gRPC for making method calls from the frontend to handle received and processed data on the backend.
- Displaying the parsed and interpreted data on the screen.
